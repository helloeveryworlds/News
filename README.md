## Background

Front end:
1. Designed and implemented an AJAX social network web application with React JS for users to create and browse posts. 
2. Used token-based registration/login/logout flow with React Router v4 and server-side user authentication with JWT to reduce cyber-attacks. 

Back end:
1. Launched a scalable web service in Go to handle posts and deployed the Google Cloud (Google App Engine).
2. Used ElasticSearch (deployed the GCE) to provide search functions such that users can search recent posts and list personal posts.
